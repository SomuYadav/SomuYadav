### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Somendra, an iOS Engineer based in Bengaluru, India. I currently work as an SDE-III at Walmart and I'm passionate about building beautiful, user-friendly apps for iOS. I believe that a well-designed app can make a big impact on people's lives and I strive to create apps that are not only functional 
but also visually appealing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SWiftUI Project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MetalKit
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mostly active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somendrayadav/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Somendra_Dev)

Here are some of my recent projects:

ðŸ“± SwiftUI2: This is an Instagram-like app built using SwiftUI 2.0 components. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the new features of SwiftUI 2.0 and creating a visually appealing UI.

ðŸ”’ AppauthWrapper: This is an AppAuth extension framework that helps reduce the amount of AppAuth code and provides short methods for Sign-in and Sign-Out. This makes managing authentication code a lot easier and more streamlined.

ðŸŽµ iTunes-ProgrammaticUI-UICompositionalLayout-NSDiffableDataSource: This is a programmatic iTunes app UI that demonstrates the use of SnapKit, Dark & Light Mode, UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, Debounce (for search), Customized AVPlayerViewController, and Apple's Native Highlight. It's a great example of how to create a seamless user experience.

ðŸ”’ SYPinView: This is a simple OTP View for iOS. It's a great addition to any app that requires secure logins.

I'm always open to feedback, so feel free to reach out and send me your thoughts. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and I welcome any suggestions or critiques. Happy coding! ðŸš€
